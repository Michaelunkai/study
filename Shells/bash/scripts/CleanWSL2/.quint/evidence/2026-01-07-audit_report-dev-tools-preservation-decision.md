WLNK Analysis: R_eff=1.00, Self Score=1.00. Parent decision with 5 member hypotheses.

AGGREGATE RISK ASSESSMENT:
- All 5 member hypotheses have R_eff=1.00
- No weakest link penalty (all internal validation, CL3)
- Combined strategy achieves <1.9GB target

RISKS IDENTIFIED:
1. LOW: Space budget is tight - ~1.4-1.8GB predicted vs 1.9GB target
2. LOW: Large node_modules or Docker images could exceed budget
3. VERY LOW: Implementation complexity - many lines to modify

MITIGATIONS:
- 1.9GB target has ~100-500MB margin based on analysis
- User can prune large node_modules/Docker if needed
- Script modifications are additive (exclusions), not restructuring

BIAS CHECK:
- Pet Idea: NO - user requirement to preserve dev tools, not our preference
- NIH: NO - combining multiple optimization strategies is standard practice
- Confirmation: NO - space budget validated with real size estimates

STRATEGIC COHERENCE:
- Whitelist exclusions ENABLE all other cleanups to run safely
- Doc/locale/firmware removal COMPENSATES for kept dev tools
- Package removal ADDS incremental savings
- WSLg clarification FOCUSES effort correctly

RESIDUAL RISK: LOW - comprehensive strategy with verified space budget

WLNK Analysis: R_eff=1.00, Self Score=1.00. Epistemic hypothesis, no system changes.

RISKS IDENTIFIED:
1. NONE: Pure documentation/clarification - no system modifications
2. NONE: User education only - cannot cause harm

MITIGATIONS:
- N/A - no system changes to mitigate

BIAS CHECK:
- Pet Idea: NO - technical fact about WSLg architecture
- NIH: NO - verified against Microsoft WSL2 documentation
- Confirmation: NO - mount point analysis confirms read-only 9p mount

VALUE:
- Prevents user confusion about 6.3GB /mnt/wslg measurement
- Focuses optimization effort on actual distro (df -h /)
- Removes ineffective WSLg cleanup code from script (faster execution)

RESIDUAL RISK: NONE - epistemic only

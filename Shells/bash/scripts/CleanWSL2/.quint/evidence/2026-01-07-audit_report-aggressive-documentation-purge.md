WLNK Analysis: R_eff=1.00, Self Score=1.00. No dependencies.

RISKS IDENTIFIED:
1. LOW: man command won't work after cleanup (acceptable for minimal distro)
2. LOW: --help flags still work (not affected by /usr/share/doc removal)
3. VERY LOW: Some packages may fail to install if they require docs (rare)

MITIGATIONS:
- Script already implements most doc removal - proven working
- Can reinstall man-db if man pages needed later
- APT restoration at end ensures package management works

BIAS CHECK:
- Pet Idea: NO - doc removal is standard WSL2 optimization
- NIH: NO - approach matches Docker slim images, Alpine, etc.
- Confirmation: NO - verified space estimates against typical Ubuntu install

RESIDUAL RISK: VERY LOW - documentation removal is safe and reversible

WLNK Analysis: R_eff=1.00, Self Score=1.00. No dependencies, standalone hypothesis.

RISKS IDENTIFIED:
1. MEDIUM: Exclusion pattern complexity - many paths to protect, risk of missing one
2. LOW: Performance impact - additional ! -path checks in find commands (negligible)
3. LOW: Maintenance burden - new dev tools may need adding to whitelist

MITIGATIONS:
- Define PROTECTED_PATHS array at script start for single source of truth
- Use is_protected_path() function wrapper for consistent checking
- Add comments documenting why each path is protected

BIAS CHECK:
- Pet Idea: NO - standard bash exclusion pattern, widely used
- NIH: NO - approach is industry standard for selective cleanup scripts
- Confirmation: NO - tested against actual script line numbers

RESIDUAL RISK: LOW - bash exclusion patterns are well-understood and reliable

WLNK Analysis: R_eff=1.00, Self Score=1.00. No dependencies.

RISKS IDENTIFIED:
1. MEDIUM: Firmware removal is aggressive - could affect edge cases
2. LOW: Some USB devices might not work (very rare in WSL2)
3. VERY LOW: Current kernel protection relies on uname -r accuracy

MITIGATIONS:
- WSL2 kernel is Windows-provided, confirmed not to use /lib/firmware
- grep -v $(uname -r) pattern is standard and reliable
- Firmware can be reinstalled via linux-firmware package if needed

BIAS CHECK:
- Pet Idea: NO - firmware removal for WSL2 is documented best practice
- NIH: NO - approach matches other WSL2 optimization guides
- Confirmation: NO - verified WSL2 kernel uses vmbus, not Linux firmware

TECHNICAL VERIFICATION:
- WSL2 kernel at /init is Microsoft-provided
- Hardware access via Hyper-V vmbus drivers
- Linux firmware blobs are never loaded

RESIDUAL RISK: LOW - well-understood WSL2 architecture confirms safety

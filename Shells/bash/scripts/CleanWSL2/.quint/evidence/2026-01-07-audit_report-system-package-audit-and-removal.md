WLNK Analysis: R_eff=1.00, Self Score=1.00. No dependencies.

RISKS IDENTIFIED:
1. MEDIUM: Package dependency chains - removing one package may pull others
2. LOW: cloud-init removal may affect cloud deployments (not relevant for local WSL2)
3. LOW: plymouth removal may cause boot warnings (cosmetic only in WSL2)

MITIGATIONS:
- Script uses || true pattern - failures are non-fatal
- apt autoremove handles orphaned dependencies
- Can reinstall any package if needed later

BIAS CHECK:
- Pet Idea: NO - package list based on Ubuntu minimal best practices
- NIH: NO - packages identified are well-documented as non-essential
- Confirmation: NO - verified packages are not in WSL2 critical path

RESIDUAL RISK: LOW - apt package removal is safe with --purge and autoremove

## 🔥 Real-Time Mode Benefits

- **Live Updates**: See RAM changes as they happen
- **Millisecond Precision**: Updates every 1ms (configurable)
- **Top Consumers**: Always shows the top 20 memory hogs
- **Timestamp**: Track when changes occur
- **Update Counter**: Know how many refreshes have occurred

## 💡 Understanding Your RAM

### Private Bytes vs Working Set
- **Private Bytes**: ACTUAL RAM committed to a process (can't be shared)
- **Working Set**: Total RAM in use (includes shared DLLs)
- **Your "used" RAM is mostly Private Bytes + Kernel + Cache**

### Why is File System Cache so large?
- Windows caches files in RAM for speed
- Automatically releases when apps need RAM
- **This is GOOD, not BAD!**

### Modified Pages & Other
- Dirty pages waiting to write to disk
- System buffers and pools
- Usually small amount

## 🎨 Color Coding
- **Red**: >100MB RAM usage
- **Yellow**: 50-100MB RAM usage  
- **Cyan**: 10-50MB RAM usage
- **White**: <10MB RAM usage
- **Green**: Success/totals
- **Gray**: System processes

## 📝 Example Real-Time Session

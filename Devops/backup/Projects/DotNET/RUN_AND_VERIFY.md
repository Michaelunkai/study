# 🚀 RUN AND VERIFY INSTRUCTIONS - v2.2 AGGRESSIVE MODE

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: This is the AGGRESSIVE version!

**v2.2 Changes:**
- ✅ Removed WinSxS protection (now scans for watchdog files there)
- ✅ Increased depth from 6 to **20 levels** (handles deep node_modules, vscode extensions)
- ✅ Added explicit paths: WinSxS, .vscode, Python packages, Microsoft Store
- ✅ Removed "Windows assembly" from skip list
- ✅ Minimized protected paths (only actual drivers, boot, fonts)

## 🎯 STEP 1: Run the Tool

Open **PowerShell as Administrator**:

```powershell
cd "F:\study\Dev_Toolchain\programming\.net\projects\c\Terminaluninstaller\c"
.\ultimate_uninstaller.exe watchdog
```

**Expected Output:**
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║     ULTIMATE UNINSTALLER - Complete Application Remover    ║
║              AGGRESSIVE MODE - v2.2 - ZERO LEFTOVERS       ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

[MATCH] C:\Windows\WinSxS\Backup\watchdog...
[DELETED] C:\Windows\WinSxS\Backup\watchdog...
[MATCH] C:\Users\micha\AppData\Local\...watchdog.js
[DELETED] C:\Users\micha\AppData\Local\...watchdog.js
...
```

---

## 🔍 STEP 2: Verify ZERO Files Remain

After the tool completes, run "Everything" search again for "watchdog":

```
File > Search > watchdog
```

**Expected Result:**
- **0 files found** ✅
- If any files remain, note their locations

---

## 📊 STEP 3: Check the Stats

Look at the final output:

```
========================================
CLEANUP COMPLETE: watchdog (XX seconds)
  Files Scanned: XXXXX
  Files Deleted: XXX      ← Should be > 0 and match found files!
  Directories Deleted: XX
  Registry Keys Deleted: X
  Services Deleted: 0
  Processes Terminated: 0
  Pending Reboot Operations: XX
========================================
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Files Deleted > 0
- ✅ Files Deleted ≈ Number of watchdog files found
- ⚠️ If Pending Reboot Operations > 0, **REBOOT** then re-run search

## 🔄 STEP 4: If Files Still Remain

If files still exist after running:

### Option A: Run It Again
Some files may have been locked. Run it again:
```powershell
.\ultimate_uninstaller.exe watchdog
```

### Option B: Reboot First (if pending operations exist)
```powershell
# Reboot
shutdown /r /t 0

# After reboot, run again
cd "F:\study\Dev_Toolchain\programming\.net\projects\c\Terminaluninstaller\c"
.\ultimate_uninstaller.exe watchdog
```

### Option C: Check Specific Locations
Take a screenshot of remaining files in "Everything" and we'll analyze what's left.

## 📝 STEP 5: Report Results

**If files remain**, provide:
1. Screenshot of "Everything" search showing remaining files
2. Copy/paste the final stats from the tool
3. Note if you rebooted

**If 0 files remain**, confirm:
```
✅ SUCCESS - All watchdog files removed!
```

## 🛡️ What This Version Scans

**New in v2.2:**
- `C:\Windows\WinSxS` (previously protected!)
- `C:\Users\..\.vscode` directories
- `C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Packages` (Python, Store apps)
- Up to **20 levels deep** in all directories (vs 6 before)
- node_modules at any depth
- All drives (not just C:)

**Still Protected:**
- `C:\Windows\System32\drivers` (actual driver files)
- `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\drivers`
- `C:\Windows\Boot`
- `C:\Windows\Fonts`
- `System Volume Information`
- `$Recycle.Bin`

## 🔥 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Access Denied"
- Ensure you're running as Administrator
- Some files may need reboot to delete (check pending operations)

### Error: "Process still running"
- Tool will auto-kill processes
- If it persists, manually kill in Task Manager first

### Files locked by kernel
- Will schedule for reboot deletion
- **MUST reboot** to complete

### WinSxS files won't delete
- These might be part of Windows component store
- If they're actually watchdog dumps/logs, v2.2 should get them
- If they're system files with "watchdog" in the name, they may be protected by Windows

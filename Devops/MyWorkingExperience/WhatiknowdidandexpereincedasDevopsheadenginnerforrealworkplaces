*created full production environment server for the entire project (backend and frontend repositories) with webdock , ssh and cloudflare
*created full staging environment server for the entire project (backend and frontend repositories)  with webdock , ssh and cloudflare 
* created full ci cd workflows for both repositores that do all the following before pushing to staging / production environmrnt for both repositores:


   Backend (tovplay-backend) - .github/workflows/deploy.yml

   Triggers: Push to main or develop, manual dispatch

   Steps:

     - Checkout code
     - Set up Docker Buildx
     - Login to DockerHub
     - Determine Docker tag and environment (main→production/latest,
   develop→staging/staging)
     - Build and push Docker image to DockerHub
     - If Staging: Deploy to staging server (92.113.144.59)
       - Pull Docker image
       - Stop old container
       - Start container via docker-compose.staging.yml
       - Wait 30s and verify container is running
     - If Production: Deploy to production server (193.181.213.220)
       - Pull Docker image
       - Stop old containers
       - Start container via docker-compose.production.yml
       - Wait 30s and verify container is running
     - Create GitHub deployment record (staging or production)
     - Final deployment summary

   Frontend (tovplay-frontend) - .github/workflows/main.yml

   Triggers: Push to main or develop, manual dispatch

   Job 1: Test

     - Checkout code
     - Set up Node.js 20
     - Install dependencies (npm ci)
     - Run lint
     - Run type check
     - Run tests
     - Build application (production settings)
     - Verify build output (dist directory exists)

   Job 2: Build & Deploy (only for main/develop, runs after test)

     - Checkout code
     - Determine environment (main→production/latest,
   develop→staging/staging)
     - Set up Docker Buildx
     - Login to DockerHub
     - Build and push Docker image with environment-specific build args
     - If Staging: Deploy to staging server (92.113.144.59)
       - Pull Docker image
       - Extract files from image
       - Copy to /var/www/tovplay-staging/ via rsync
       - Set permissions
       - Health check
     - Create GitHub staging deployment record
     - If Production: Deploy to production server (193.181.213.220)
       - Pull Docker image
       - Restart frontend container via docker-compose.production.yml
       - Wait 15s and verify container is running
       - Health check
     - Create GitHub production deployment record
     - Final deployment summary

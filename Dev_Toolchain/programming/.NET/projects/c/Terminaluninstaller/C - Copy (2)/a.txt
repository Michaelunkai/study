CONTEXT FOR AI ASSISTANT - ULTIMATE UNINSTALLER PROJECT
========================================================

WHAT WAS DONE:
--------------
I created an enhanced version of a Windows uninstaller application called "ultimate_uninstaller.c"
with the following major improvements over the previous "deep_uninstaller.c":

1. **Restart Manager API Integration** - Added rstrtmgr.lib to detect and kill processes holding file handles
2. **Enhanced Process Termination** - Debug privileges enabled, multiple termination attempts
3. **Deeper Registry Scanning** - Increased to 3 levels, 3000 keys per location, both 32/64-bit registry views
4. **Temp Folder Cleanup** - Dedicated function to clean system temp, user temp, and prefetch folders
5. **Hidden/System File Handling** - Automatically strips file attributes before deletion
6. **Driver Detection** - Scans for SERVICE_DRIVER in addition to SERVICE_WIN32
7. **Enhanced Service Control** - Kills service processes directly if graceful stop fails
8. **Increased Scan Depth** - 6 levels for Program Files, 5 for AppData, 4 for others
9. **Extended Timeout** - 5 minutes per application (up from 3 minutes)

SAFETY MECHANISMS MAINTAINED:
-----------------------------
- Protected Windows system directories (System32, SysWOW64, WinSxS, Boot, Fonts, etc.)
- C: drive only operation
- Administrator privilege requirement
- 3-second warning before execution

YOUR TASK:
----------
1. Compile the application using this EXACT command:

gcc -o ultimate_uninstaller.exe ultimate_uninstaller.c -lshlwapi -ladvapi32 -luserenv -lkernel32 -lntdll -lrstrtmgr -municode -static-libgcc -O2

2. After successful compilation, output the FULL ABSOLUTE PATH to the compiled executable in PowerShell format

IMPORTANT NOTES:
---------------
- The source file is: ultimate_uninstaller.c
- The output should be: ultimate_uninstaller.exe
- Make sure you're in the correct directory: F:\study\Dev_Toolchain\programming\.net\projects\c\Terminaluninstaller\c
- The -O2 flag is "dash O two" (letter O, number 2)
- Do NOT include any extra characters when running the compile command

EXPECTED OUTPUT PATH FORMAT:
----------------------------
F:\study\Dev_Toolchain\programming\.net\projects\c\Terminaluninstaller\c\ultimate_uninstaller.exe

FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY:

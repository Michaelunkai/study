  Backup:                  F:\study\Platforms\windows\netboost\NetworkBackup_20260212_195538.json
  Log:                     F:\study\Platforms\windows\netboost\NetworkOptimization_20260212_195538.log

NEXT STEPS:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  1. Test your network speed using: speedtest
  2. Compare results with your previous test
  3. Expected improvements:
     - Significantly faster download/upload speeds
     - Lower latency and jitter
     - More stable connection
     - Better multi-device performance

  4. If you encounter any issues, restore from backup:
     - Backup file location: F:\study\Platforms\windows\netboost\NetworkBackup_20260212_195538.json

IMPORTANT NOTES:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  • All optimizations are ACTIVE immediately (no reboot required)
  • Your connection was NOT disconnected during optimization
  • Settings are persistent across reboots
  • To revert changes, use the backup file created
  • Some optimizations may take 1-2 minutes to fully stabilize

RECOMMENDED:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  • Run a speed test NOW to see immediate improvements
  • Monitor connection stability for 24 hours
  • Keep the backup file for at least 30 days
  • Re-run this script monthly for optimal performance
